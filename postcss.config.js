// This is a PostCSS configuration file that uses Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer as plugins.
// It exports an object with a `plugins` property, which contains the two plugins as key-value pairs.
// The `tailwindcss` plugin is used for generating utility classes based on the Tailwind CSS framework,
// and the `autoprefixer` plugin is used for adding vendor prefixes to CSS properties for better browser compatibility.
// This configuration is typically used in a project that uses Tailwind CSS for styling and PostCSS for processing CSS files.
// The file is named `postcss.config.js` and is usually placed in the root directory of a project.
// The file is automatically detected by PostCSS when processing CSS files, so you don't need to import it explicitly in your code.
// The plugins will be applied to any CSS files processed by PostCSS, allowing you to use Tailwind CSS classes and ensure cross-browser compatibility with vendor prefixes.
